# NAVER Data Science Competition 2018 Qualifying Round

I made this program for qualifying round of NAVER Data Science Competition 2018.

I made a computational model for breast tumor malignancy prediction with a deep neural network.

I downloaded "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set" from <https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data#data.csv>.

The dataset contains data of 569 breast tumor tissues.

My neural network gets 30 characteristics of cell nucleus of breast tumor tissues and computes malignant tumor score and benign tumor score.
